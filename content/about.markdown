Hi everyone!

My name is Henrique Dias, I am portuguese and I live in Portugal. I am attending secondary school in a scientific-humanistic course called "Science and Technology" that I hope finish in 2017. After it I want to study Computer Science.

I want to be a Software Engineer. My objective is do something usefull for the world.


## Long version


My interest for computers arose at when I was a little child. My father bought his first computer when I was 4 or 5 years. My father simply opened Microsoft Word and I kept clicking randomly on the keys. I just clicked on numbers and letters of the alphabet because my father told me to not click on “F” keys and other keys because he didn’t know that they worked. At the time I couldn’t read or write. I just looked at the screen and clicked on the keys.

Over the years, my curiosity about computers has increased because I’m always exploring new things and functionalities that I didn’t know that there were. Currently I’m improving my programming skills. Codecademy is one of the sites that I attend but there are others. Thanks, Codecademy!

I want to become a programmer because all the reasons that I’ve talked about and many others. My favorite thing about programming is that we can make anything that we want with code. We can create, inovate, improve and have fun!

I think that all the world should learn how to program because it is too much important in current days and it is a good form to have fun and practise our brain and estimulate our creativity.
