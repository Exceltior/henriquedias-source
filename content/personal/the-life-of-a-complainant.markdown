Everyday I hear people complaining here and there. They complain about almost everything: from the pencil which isn't on its place to the government's rules. I think is doesn't occurs only here, of course. Maybe it's a problem of adults (some of them, no offense). I see them complaining every single second. If you're not this type of person, I believe you should have seen some of them.

Complaining **does**:

+ ~~Decrease~~ increase your stress;
+ Make you feel ~~good~~ bad;
+ Among many other things I'm not going to mention.

Complaining **doesn't do**: changes. The changes are in the centre, they're fundamental to solve a problem. Something has to change to get rid of a problem.

I can't imagine a complainant's life: boring, always upset, dull (and all of the adjectives related to "boring"). I don't want that life, I **don't** want a life of problems, complaints, problems, complaints and no changes!

So, what should we do? **ACT!** Act can lead to **results**, to **improvements**, complaints doesn't. There are a lot of ways to act: simply spreading the word, thinking in ideas to solve the problems, put them into practice, etc. I you can make changes, you'll feel better.

And now, it's my turn to admir: yes, I'm complaining but I'm also acting, spreading the word.
